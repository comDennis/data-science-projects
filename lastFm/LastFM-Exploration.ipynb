    "# Collaborative item-based filtering for music artists\n",
    "Within this notebook I built a recommender for music artists using a collaborative item-based filtering approach. As a basis, I used the last.fm-dataset which can be found [here](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/index.html). The content of the notebook is based on [this](https://beckernick.github.io/music_recommender/) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender has been deployed in a sample web-application and can be found [here](https://denmei.github.io/): ![artist_recommender](img/artist_recommender.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical background\n",
    "To provide a better understanding of the approach, here's a small introduction (from Wikipedia, I have to admit).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration aming multiple agents, viewpoints, data sources etc.\n",
    "* There exist different approaches for collaborative filtering:\n",
    "    * **User-based**: Use ratings from like-minded users to give a recommendation for the active user\n",
    "    * **Item-based**: Build item-item-matrix determining similiarity between pairs of items &rarr; Use tastes of current user to find similar items\n",
    "\n",
    "### Item-based collaborative filtering\n",
    "**How do we get the similarities?**\n",
    "* Look at users who rated both items \n",
    "* Similarity is dependend on the ratings given by users who have rated both of them\n",
    "* There exist a lot of different metrics to measure this similarity, e.g. Cosine-similarity, Euclidian Distance...\n",
    "![Item-based CF](img/icollaborative_filtering.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we use the similarities?**\n",
    "* We use the most similar items to the ones the user already rated to generate a list of recommendations\n",
    "* *people who rate item X highly, like you, also tend to rate item Y highly, and you haven't rated item Y yet, so you should try it*"
